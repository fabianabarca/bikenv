Installation
==========

If you have all the dependencies installed and tested on your device, you can install the package locally using the package's GitHub repository by using the following code. It's important to note that as a package in development, it is not available online, so it's necessary to use GitHub to obtain it.
.. code-block:: console
    pip install git+REPOSITORY_URL

It's important to have the necessary libraries to be able to use the package. The required libraries are in the Getting Started section.
